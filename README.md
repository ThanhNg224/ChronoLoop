# ChronoLoop Platformer game

ChronoLoop is an innovative 2D platformer game that challenges players to think outside the box with its unique time-manipulation mechanic. The game introduces a groundbreaking feature: the ability to record a player's movements and actions and then replay them strategically to solve puzzles, overcome obstacles, and complete levels. This mechanic creates a blend of strategic planning and skill-based gameplay, offering players a refreshing and engaging experience.

Core Gameplay Mechanics
At its core, ChronoLoop revolves around two fundamental concepts: recording and playback. Players can:

Record their movements and actions in real time, such as running, jumping, or any combination of these.
Replay their recordings during crucial moments to create an echo of their past actions, effectively working alongside their "past self" to complete challenges.
This mechanic transforms traditional platformer gameplay into a strategic puzzle-solving experience. Players must think creatively, plan their moves carefully, and utilize both their current and recorded actions to progress.
